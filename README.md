Project Manager Kit for Modo 801
==============

***CAUTION: THIS IS A WIP***


***For Modo 801 Linux only, as Modo does not support Qt on Windows and Mac.***


This kit attempts to fill a gap in Modo's production workflow by providing a way to create and manage projects on a basic level. This kit deals strictly with high-level functions and root structures, and does not attempt to manage dependencies, databases, or entity-specific subdirectory structures.
